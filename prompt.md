https://www.nmjanitsjar.no/ is a page which has data about all the national competitions in Norway for Wind Band Orchestras from 1981 to 2025 (not all years had competitions)

The page has results per year listed under RESULTATER

2025: https://www.nmjanitsjar.no/2025/04/resultater-2025.html
2024: https://www.nmjanitsjar.no/2024/03/resultater-2024.html
2023: https://www.nmjanitsjar.no/2023/03/resultater-2023.html
2022: https://www.nmjanitsjar.no/2022/04/resultater-2022.html
and so on.

For each year a long list of all the contestants are listed in order of placement per divison. For each divison there is a best soloist price and a best group price. The name of the orchestra, what they played, how many points they got (max is 100) and the conductor are listed. Most orchestras also have an image. The name of the orchestra, the piece(s) and the conductor are all linked to separate pages that focus on this data. 

Note: The number of divisions has increased through the years, and in 2025 we had an Elite division and 1.-7. divison (8 divisons in total).

I want to fetch all this data and store it in a structured manner locally. My goal is to be able to analyse this data and then I eventually need it in some sort of database, but csv files or even structured markdown pages will do in the first step.
